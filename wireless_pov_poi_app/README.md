```
for (col = 0; col < width; col++) {
    for (row = 0; row < height; row++) {
        bytes[index++] = red;
        bytes[index++] = green;
        bytes[index++] = blue;
    }
}
```

### Performance

- **BLE range**: ~10 meters (clear line of sight)
- **Multi-device**: Up to 7 poi simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found

- Check poi is powered on
- Enable Bluetooth on phone/computer
- Move closer to poi (<10m)
- Restart app and try again

### Connection Failed

- Disable WiFi on poi (if active)
- Restart poi and retry
- Check Bluetooth adapter is BLE 4.0+ (Windows)

### Pattern Upload Failed

- Check pattern dimensions (≤31×400 pixels)
- Check total pixels (≤40,000)
- Move closer to poi
- Reconnect and retry

### Web Version Not Working

- Use Chrome or Edge browser (Firefox/Safari unsupported)
- Enable Web Bluetooth: `chrome://flags/#enable-web-bluetooth`
- Use HTTPS connection (required for Web Bluetooth)
- Note: iOS does not support Web Bluetooth
