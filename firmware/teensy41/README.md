# Teensy 4.1 Firmware - PlatformIO Version

✅ **Status**: Advanced Version - Core features complete, integration testing recommended

This directory contains a **modular PlatformIO-based** firmware for the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. This version is designed for advanced users who need a professional, maintainable codebase.

## 🚦 Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- **SD Card Storage**: High-speed SDIO storage for POV images
- **LED Driver**: APA102 LED control with FastLED
- **POV Engine**: Persistence of vision rendering with pattern support
- **Serial Protocol**: Both simple and structured message protocols
- **ESP32 Command Processing**: All commands implemented
- **Pattern Generation**: 4 pattern types (rainbow, wave, gradient, sparkle)
- **Frame Rate Control**: Dynamic adjustment (10-120 FPS)
- **Mode Management**: Full mode and index support
- **Brightness Control**: 0-255 adjustable
- **Image Display**: 31x64 pixel POV images

### ⚠️ Needs Testing
- **Integration Testing**: Hardware validation with ESP32 web interface
- **Live Drawing Mode**: Implemented, needs end-to-end testing
- **Sequence Playback**: Framework in place, needs implementation

### 📋 Recommended Action
**Both firmware versions are now feature-complete** for core functionality. Choose based on your needs:
- **Arduino IDE**: Single-file, quick setup, proven in production
- **PlatformIO**: Modular, professional build system, easier to extend

See [FIRMWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../FIRMWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed comparison.

## Overview

The firmware manages:
- **APA102 LED Control**: High-speed LED strip driving for smooth POV display
- **ESP32 Communication**: Serial interface for receiving image data and commands
- **POV Engine**: Persistence of vision display rendering based on rotation
- **SD Card Storage**: High-speed SDIO storage for POV images

## Hardware Requirements

- Teensy 4.1 development board
- APA102 LED strip (32 LEDs: 31 for display, 1 for level shifting)
- ESP32 co-processor (connected via Serial1)
- microSD card (Class 10 or higher, 16GB-64GB recommended)
  - Format: FAT32 (recommended) or exFAT, single partition
  - Quick format, keep 10–20% free space for optimal performance
  - See [docs/SD_CARD_STORAGE.md](../../docs/SD_CARD_STORAGE.md) for detailed preparation guide
- Power supply suitable for LED strip

## Pin Configuration

| Function | Pin | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| LED Data | 11 | APA102 data line |
| LED Clock | 13 | APA102 clock line |
| ESP32 RX | 0 | Serial1 RX for ESP32 communication |
| ESP32 TX | 1 | Serial1 TX for ESP32 communication |
| SD Card | Built-in | Teensy 4.1 built-in microSD slot (SDIO) |

## Building and Uploading

## Configuration

Edit `include/config.h` to customize:
- LED strip length (`NUM_LEDS`)
- Pin assignments
- Communication settings
- Display parameters
- SD card settings (`SD_CARD_ENABLED`, `SD_IMAGE_DIR`, etc.)

## Communication Protocol

The firmware uses a simple packet-based protocol for ESP32 communication:

**Message Format:**
```
[TYPE][LENGTH_H][LENGTH_L][DATA...][CHECKSUM]
```

**Message Types:**
- `0x01`: Image data
- `0x02`: Command
- `0x03`: Status
- `0x04`: ACK
- `0x05`: NACK
- `0x10`: Save image to SD (NEW)
- `0x11`: List images on SD (NEW)
- `0x12`: Delete image from SD (NEW)
- `0x13`: Get SD card info (NEW)
- `0x14`: Load image from SD (NEW)

**Commands:**
- `0x01`: Play
- `0x02`: Pause
- `0x03`: Stop
- `0x04`: Set brightness
- `0x05`: Set mode
